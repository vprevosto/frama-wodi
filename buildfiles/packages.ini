descr="From the ergo web site:\nErgo is an automatic theorem prover dedicated to program\nverification. Ergo is based on CC(X) a congruence closure algorithm\nparameterized by an equational theory X. Currently, CC(X) can be\ninstanciated by the empty equational theory and by the linear\narithmetics."

descr="From the coq web site:\nCoq is a formal proof management system: a proof done with Coq is\nmechanically checked by the machine. In particular, Coq allows:\n\n    * to define functions or predicates,\n    * to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,\n    * to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,\n    * to check these proofs by a relatively small certification \"kernel\".\n"

comment="Modular C static analyser"
descr="Frama-C stands for FRAmework for Modular Analysis of C. It provides a generic\nframework (based on the CIL library) for building static analyzers for\nC programs. It features an annotation language, called ACSL, in which\nit is possible possible to express the formal properties that the code under\nanalysis is expected to meet.\nCurrent analyzers include:\n- an abstract interpreter\n- a code slicer\n- an impact analysis tool\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE for user upgrading from a previous version:\nStarting from  Frama-C Beryllium 20090902 and why 2.21, Jessie plug-in is \nnow provided directly by apps-why. There is no local why installation anymore.\n"
