From the coq web site:
Coq is a formal proof management system: a proof done with Coq is
mechanically checked by the machine. In particular, Coq allows:

    * to define functions or predicates,
    * to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,
    * to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,
    * to check these proofs by a relatively small certification "kernel".
