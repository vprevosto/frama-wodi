- In order to build Alt-ergo GUI, godi-lablgtk2 must be installed with
gtksourceview2 support. Please ensure that gtksourceview2
and its header files are installed on your system. If this is not the
case, install them and ask godi to rebuild godi-lablgtk2 (if
godi-lablgtk2 hasn't been built yet, you only need to ensure that
gtksourceview is correctly installed, godi will take care of the
rest).

Available options:
- CONF_ALTERGO_ENABLE_GUI: enables the GUI (altgr-ergo).
  Can be set to yes, no, or auto (default is auto)
  - yes will force the GUI to be built, and fail if this cannot be done
  - no will not build the GUI
  - auto will build the GUI if lablgtk2 has the necessary support (see above)
