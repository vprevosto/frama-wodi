IMPORTANT NOTES:
- As of release Beryllium 20090902, jessie plugin is included in Why
distribution. Why itself is not installable from apps-frama-c anymore, only
through apps-why.

- In order to build Frama-C's GUI, godi-lablgtk2 must have been
compiled with gtksourceview support. Please ensure that gtksourceview
and its header files are installed on your system. If this is not the
case, install them and ask godi to rebuild godi-lablgtk2 (if
godi-lablgtk2 hasn't been built yet, you only need to ensure that
gtksourceview is correctly installed, godi will take care of the
rest).

Available options:

- CONF_FRAMAC_API_DOC: installs the kernel api documentation under
                      share/frama-c/doc (defaults: no)

- CONF_FRAMAC_ENABLE_GUI: enables the gui plugin.
Can be set to yes, no or auto (default: auto).
- yes will force the gui to be compiled and fails if this can not be done
- no will disable the gui altogether
- auto forces a dependency on godi-lablgtk2, but won't complain is support
  for gtksourceview2 is missing, just disabling the gui.

- CONF_FRAMAC_ACSL_EL: installs acsl.el into share/emacs/site-lisp 
     (yes/no option, default: yes)

- CONF_FRAMAC_START_SHORTCUT: on wodi distribution, adds a shortcut in the
  windows start menu (yes/no option, default: yes)
