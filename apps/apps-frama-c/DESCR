Frama-C stands for FRAmework for Modular Analysis of C. It provides a generic
framework (based on the CIL library) for building static analyzers for
C programs. It features an annotation language, called ACSL, in which
it is possible possible to express the formal properties that the code under
analysis is expected to meet.
Current analyzers include:
- an abstract interpreter
- a code slicer
- an impact analysis tool

IMPORTANT NOTE for user upgrading from a previous version:
Starting from  Frama-C Beryllium 20090902 and why 2.21, Jessie plug-in is 
now provided directly by apps-why. There is no local why installation anymore.
